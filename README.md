# HPC-Project

## Abstract
 This project developed a high-performance linear algebra library using only the C++17 standard library,
 f
 illing a gap as the C++ standard library lacks built-in support for linear algebra operations. The li
brary supports critical operations such as matrix multiplication and LU factorization, each optimized
 using a block algorithm approach. Built on object-oriented principles, this library offers scalability and
 user-friendliness. Moreover, the use of C++17 features such as auto type deduction, lambda expressions,
 and parallel execution policy enabled the implementation of parallel versions of the functions, thereby
 improving performance on multi-core computers. The library supports both dense and sparse matrix
 classes, implementing COO and CSR data structures for sparse matrices. Performance evaluations indi
cate that my library achieves faster LU factorization runtimes compared to the widely-used Eigen library.
 Conclusively, this project has successfully developed an efficient, user-friendly, and highly scalable linear
 algebra library, providing a powerful tool for scientific computing and engineering applications.
