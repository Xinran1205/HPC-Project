# HPC-Project

## Abstract
This project developed a high-performance linear algebra library using only the C++17 standard library, filling a gap as the C++ standard library lacks built-in support for linear algebra operations. The library supports critical operations such as matrix multiplication and LU factorization, each optimized using a block algorithm approach. Built on object-oriented principles, this library offers scalability and user-friendliness. Moreover, the use of C++17 features such as auto type deduction, lambda expressions, and parallel execution policy enabled the implementation of parallel versions of the functions, thereby improving performance on multi-core computers. The library supports both dense and sparse matrix classes, implementing COO and CSR data structures for sparse matrices. Performance evaluations indicate that my library achieves faster LU factorization runtimes compared to the widely-used Eigen library. Conclusively, this project has successfully developed an efficient, user-friendly, and highly scalable linear algebra library, providing a powerful tool for scientific computing and engineering applications.
